# Conclusion
In this laboratory work I created a simple Unity "Space Shooter". This laboratory work reminded me "Game Development" as I practiced it year ago. It was interesting to see "what's new" in Unity, while I was away... After one year without Game Development, I could say that Unity is GREAT. It has a lot of features and possibilities. Maybe I'll try soon to develop another game in Unity after developing "Chisinau Public Transport" year ago. Unity is cool....even if it's hard to write beauty code.
